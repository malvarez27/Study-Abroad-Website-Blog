    <p class="mb-0">In New Zealand history, the missionary impact on the indigenous people of New Zealand,
      the Maori, was immense. The Maori adopted Christianity in large numbers in the 19th Century, but began
      to interpret and live it in their own unique manner. In this course, we will examine the particular
      impact of the Biblical Prophets of the Old Testament on the Maori. The 19th Century saw the rise of Maori
      Prophets who became significant indigenous leaders.</p>

    <h2>Week 1 Cultural Experience : Gisborne</h2>
    <blockquote class="font-weight-bold">Gisborne was out first stop in New Zealand. It was a cultural Experience
    that I will never forget. We arrived and began learning about the M훮ori culture right away. We were greeted and taken to a school
  where we were fed and had a lecture. We quickly had to learn a song titled T큰tira Mai Ng훮 Iwi which is the M훮ori folk song.
  After, the first day we drove to a Maori Marae or wharenui (meeting house) which is where we experienced
  and taking part in a powhiri (formal welcome ceremony) which is a must-do during your stay. The six main steps of a powhiri are the following;
karanga (the call of welcome), individual from the group replies to the karanga by guiding the visitor group to walk forward, formal speeches (whaikorero),
waiata (song), gift (usually a monetary) called a koha, lastly hosts line up and the guests with the men in front walk forward to press noses, called the hongi (traditional greeting
called a hariru). We stayed at several Marae's during our stay in Gisborne which was a one of a king experience that I might never have again.
