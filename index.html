    <h2>New Zealand</h2>
    <blockquote class="font-weight-bold">Summer of 2018 I had the chance to study abroad
      for a month in New Zealand. New Zealand is a very unique country to visit. It is known for their Maori culture,
    manuka honey, rugby, etc. Oh and did I mention.. SHEEP! I had an amazing time living in New Zealand in the summer.
    I cannot wait to visit again soon.  </blockquote>

  <p>THST 3200 : Prophecy and Society in New Zealand</p>
  <p>  Professor Daniel Smith-Christopher</p>
  <p>   *This course satisfies the LMU core requirement for Integrations: Faith
    and Reason as well as the Flag for Engaged Learning.*</p>
    <p class="mb-0">In New Zealand history, the missionary impact on the indigenous people of New Zealand,
      the Maori, was immense. The Maori adopted Christianity in large numbers in the 19th Century, but began
      to interpret and live it in their own unique manner. In this course, we will examine the particular
      impact of the Biblical Prophets of the Old Testament on the Maori. The 19th Century saw the rise of Maori
      Prophets who became significant indigenous leaders.</p>
